            <b>ID is unique</b><br>
            <p>
            <em>Each element can have only one ID</em><br>
            <em>Each page can have only one element with that ID.</em><br> The id selector allows you to define style rules that apply to a single element on the web page. Each web page can only have one element with a single ID attribute. This means the ID selector can never be used to style more than one element.
            ID selectors are defined using a hash sign. They are immediately followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to. Here is an example of the ID selector in action:</p>
            <img class="picture-style" src="../img/id.png"><br>
            <img class="picture-style" src="../img/idstyle.png"><br>
            
                <b>IDs Have a Unique Browser Function</b><br>
            <p>In the browser, classes have no special function. Their main purpose is to allow you to apply styles to a range of elements on a web page. IDs, on the other hand, can be used by the browser to navigate to a certain part of the web page. If you assign an element an ID, you can use a special URL to link directly to that element. This behavior works because IDs are unique on a web page.
            </p>
    
            <b>Classes are not unique</b><br>
            <p><em>You can use the same class on multiple elements.</em><br>
            <em>You can use multiple classes on the same element.</em><br>
            A class selector allows you to define style rules that apply to any element with a class attribute equal to a certain value. Classes can be used across multiple elements. So, if you apply a style using a class selector, any element which shares that class will be subject to the styles you define.
            Class selectors are defined using a period, followed by the value of the class that you want to apply a set of styles. Here’s an example of the class selector in action:<br></p>
            <img class="picture-style" src="../img/class.png"><br>
            <img class="picture-style" src="../img/classstyle.png"><br>
            
            <b>You Can Use Both ID and CSS Class Selectors</b><br>
            <p>There are no rules in HTML that prevent you from assigning an element both an ID and a class. 
            When you’re working with CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to use an ID over a class. 
            However, it is best practice to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to one element on the web page, and to use classes if you want a style to apply to multiple elements.
