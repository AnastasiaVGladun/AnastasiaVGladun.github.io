            <h1>Problem solving</h1>
            <p><b>What are problem-solving skills?</b><br>
                Problem-solving skills help you determine the source of a problem and find an effective solution. 
                Although problem solving is often identified as its own separate skill, there are other related skills that contribute to this ability.<br>
                
                <b>Some key problem-solving skills include:</b>
                
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>Trying something</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                <li>Reading error messages</li>
                <li>Console.logging</li>
                <li>Googling</li>
                <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
             </p>
             <p>
                Any solution is a trial and error method: the more you try, the more you could get confused.
                In the process of completing an assignment, not everything always goes according to plan. 
                
                 
                I follow few steps in my problem-solving routine:
                first, I need clearly understand what my problem is. I use visualization to help myself identify a problem(drawing, writing pseudocode) and a robber duck method.
                Next is googling and researching, trying something.
                When I stuck, I'll ask for advise. Am I go in the right direction or not. 
                You are researching an example of a possible solution, studying new methods, and it seemed that everything should work, 
                but something is wrong. After some time spending on solving the same problem, you could miss the obvious things like missing space, or spelling mistakes. 
                So your need to switch to something else from time to time, clear your mind, and come back later.
