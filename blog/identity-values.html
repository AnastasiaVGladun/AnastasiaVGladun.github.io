        <b>My identity, values and strengths</b><br><br><br>
        
            In general, our values are the things that we believe are important for us in our life and work.
            Many people believe that culture is an important shaper of our personality and values. 
            Culture helps define how individuals see themselves and how they relate to others. </p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Russia. I have been living in New Zealand for some time, now 
            I identify myself as a Russian Kiwi. I love Russia and New Zealand for their beautiful nature, soulful people, unique culture. 
            Both of them are multicultural countries. They contain an incredible diversity of people, beliefs, values, and lifestyles. <br>
            <p>I value many things, but I think my top values are: family, life balance, the golden rule -
            ("Treat others as you would like others to treat you"), 
            empathy, fairness, security, commitment, professionalism.</p>
            I believe culture affects our values â€” what we consider right and wrong. 
            This is how the society we live in influences our choices. But our choices can also influence others and ultimately help shape our society. I think life is a constant ethical decision, one after another. 
            We make a choice every single day. 
            Do you keep your promise? Do you treat others as you would like others to treat you? What do you choose?<br>
            I would say one of my greatest strengths is ability to organise myself even in stressing situations. 
            Also, I believe being open to other ideas can open you up to new experiences. I'm a good team player. 
            I like working with people who are committed to getting things done and actually doing it also who are passionate about their work.
            My weakness is that I can focus too much on the small details, spending a lot of time on the fine points making sure everything is perfect, or overthink the problem, which can often lead to taking more time than needed on something. 
            Sometimes I have to remind myself that best is the enemy of the good and do not need to overcomplicate things of how they really are.
