            <p>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p><br>
        
            I realized that I am patient with others but not with myself. I can't give myself a break until I solve the problem, 
            which is not right and could cause more mistakes. 
            I always help the other person, even if it'll mean put aside my work.
            <p>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
                The role of values and understanding of other peope is very important. When you start a new carrier, you become vulnerable. 
                You are not confident in your skills, knowledge and at this time is very important to have support. 
                That is when your values and personal awareness come up. To be able to help yourself and support people around you.
            <p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
            <p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
                All principles and methods are well known.It is surprising how they could change your way of thinking and way of solving problem.
                Start to use them is the hardest part, make them your habbits.
            <p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</p>
                Be a programmer is not just a write a code it is also work in a team. 
                Core part of the course helps you to understand yourself and other people. 
            <p>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
                I think studying core learning is an important part of the course. For me personally, it wasn't something new because 
                I had experience with working in a team on a project. I did a few team-building courses at my previous work as well. Even so, I found a lot of new interesting facts,
                technics and refresh my knowledge.
                But here we have people with a different background on a different stage of self-understanding so this part is a must for all.
