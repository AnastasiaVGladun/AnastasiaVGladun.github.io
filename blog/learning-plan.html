        <p>When I started thinking about changing my career, I highlighted points that are a matter for me. One of the key points was the ability to work remotely. Therefore, my goal today is to get enough knowledge/skills, and experience to find a remote job in the future.</p>
        <p>In the learning process, I will try to develop the quality of self-presentation skills. It is sometimes a problem for me, introduce myself, describe my strengths. It seems to me because of the difference in mentality, many things seem obvious, which you do not talk about for granted, but you need to mention everything.</p>
        <p>I am a very systematic person. I should have everything in order. I always make a plan first, divide it into small tasks, draw a visual picture of a solution, and so on. I consider this a helpful quality in the problem-solving process. I also have enough experience working in a team, in different roles from performer to manager, which can be good as soft skills. During the process, I can go deep into the details for a long time, so I need to keep track of the time allocated for solving the problem.</p>
        <p>I think I don't have problems with self-management. I believe that if you know why you are here, for what, then you will use every minute of the time in the right way. 
            As always, at first, I'll try to figure it out myself, but asking for help is also important. I have many friends in IT and my partner is a mobile developer, so I'll ask for their help. We also have a great facilitation team ready to help with any questions and last, but not least is my group. 
            The collective mind is a very powerful thing.</p>
        <p>I honestly don't expect anything from the facilitation team :) it's just good to know that there are always people who will help with advice, give an idea or just say that you are not an idiot :)</p>
