            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <p><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b>
            <br>When I've started thinking about changing my career, I highlighted a few points which are matter to me. One of the key points is the ability to work remotely. 
            Therefore, my goal is to get enough knowledge/skills, and experience to find a remote job in the future.
        </p>
        <p><b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b><br>
            Goes through the foundation I found that my structured way of learning is working well, so I'll try to keep it that during Bootcamp as well. Although as I understand, there would be many team/pair challenges. 
            I know how to organize myself, but I can't enforce others. It'll put more pressure on me on the challenges, so I may become hard on myself and work for perfectionism.

        </p>
        <p><b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b><br>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br>
            I think for me biggest non-technical challenge would be speaking in front of the group, making presentations. 
            It always makes me feel nervous. I was never good at it in my language and now I would need to speak in my 
            second so it'll put even more pressure on me. 
            That would be my non-technical skill, I would love to develop while at the course.
        </p>
        <p> <b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b><br>
            I expect to feel supported throughout the process. I would expect help if I'm struggling to understand concepts,
             and honest feedback on the areas I can improve in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp<br>
            I believe that I will be able to manage myself mentally and physically with bootcamp. I need to find a balance between studying and my life.
            Be able to switch from one to enother.  I need to take myself breaks do not forget about friends and family and my day to days habbits.
            It will help me to stay focused during bootcamp and do not lost myself.


        </p>
        <p><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</b>
            <br>During the learning process, I will try to develop my self-presentation skills. It is sometimes a problem for me, introduce myself, describe my strengths. 
            It seems to me because of the difference in mentality, many things look obvious, which you do not talk about for granted, but you need to mention everything.
        </p>
        <p><b>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</b><br>To my strengths, 
            I'll probably add that I am a very systematic person. I always make a plan first and try to follow it. Dividing a big problem into small tasks and drawing a 
            visual picture helps me a lot. I consider this a helpful quality in the problem-solving process. I also have enough experience working in a team, 
            in different roles from performer to manager, which is good as a soft skill. In terms of my limitations. During the process, 
            I can go deep into the details and lost count of time, so I need to keep track of the time allocated for solving the problem. The Time-box method helps me a lot with this.
        </p>
        <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</b><br>I think I don't have problems with self-management 
            in terms of organizing myself and stay focused. I believe that if you know why you are here, remember what your goal is, you will use every minute of the time in the right way. 
        </p>
        <p>Asking for help is a part of learning. I have many friends in IT and my partner is a mobile developer, 
            so I'll ask for their help first. I don't like to annoying other people, so  I start with who I know. We also have a great facilitation team ready to 
            help with any questions and last, but not least is my group. The collective mind is a very powerful thing.
        </p>
        <p>I honestly don't know what to expect from the facilitation team :)Probably it's just good to know that there are always people who 
            will help you with advice, give an idea a fresh view or simply say that you are not an idiot :)
