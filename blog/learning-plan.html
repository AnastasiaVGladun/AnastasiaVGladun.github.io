        <p>When I've started thinking about changing my career, I highlighted a few points which are matter to me. One of the key points is the ability to work remotely. Therefore, my goal is to get enough knowledge/skills, and experience to find a remote job in the future.</p>
        <p>During the learning process, I will try to develop my self-presentation skills. It is sometimes a problem for me, introduce myself, describe my strengths. It seems to me because of the difference in mentality, many things look obvious, which you do not talk about for granted, but you need to mention everything.</p>
        <p>To my strengths, I'll probably add that I am a very systematic person. I always make a plan first and try to follow it. Dividing a big problem into small tasks and drawing a visual picture helps me a lot. I consider this a helpful quality in the problem-solving process. I also have enough experience working in a team, in different roles from performer to manager, which is good as a soft skill. In terms of my limitations. During the process, I can go deep into the details and lost count of time, so I need to keep track of the time allocated for solving the problem. The Time-box method helps me a lot with this.</p>
        <p>I think I don't have problems with self-management in terms of organizing myself and stay focused. I believe that if you know why you are here, remember what your goal is, you will use every minute of the time in the right way. </p>
        <p>Asking for help is a part of learning. I have many friends in IT and my partner is a mobile developer, so I'll ask for their help first. I don't like to annoying other people, so  I start with who I know. We also have a great facilitation team ready to help with any questions and last, but not least is my group. The collective mind is a very powerful thing.</p>
        <p>I honestly don't know what to expect from the facilitation team :)Probably it's just good to know that there are always people who will help you with advice, give an idea a fresh view or simply say that you are not an idiot :)</p>
