        <p><b>The difference between IQ and EQ lies in what is being measured.</b><br>
            <li>The intelligence quotient measures your cognitive ability. For example, how much information you can retain or your problem solving skills.</li>
            <li>The emotional intelligence quotient measures an individual's ability to express, regulate, and understand their and others’ emotions.</li> </p>  
        <p><b>Why is emotional intelligence important?</b><br>
            Emotional intelligence in a work environment is just as important as having the knowledge and skills a person needs to succeed in their position. When leaders have emotional intelligence, they can inspire, motivate, and grow stronger relationships with their employees.<br>
            EQ is not only significant for creating a productive and positive working environment, but it is also substantial in self-development. People with a high EQ are not as reactionary, are more compassionate, and open-minded. </p>    
        <p><b>Examples of high emotional intelligence in a work environment:</b><br>
            Intelligence is not based just on obtaining information but on having the ability to apply it as well. Implementing and maintaining an elevated EQ in the workplace is not easy, but it is beneficial.<br>
            
            Characteristics of a work environment with high emotional intelligence can be:
            
            <li><em>Employees feel as though they can express their thoughts freely:</em> When workers are exchanging how they feel about projects or even aspects of their personal life respectfully, this is a sign of a work environment with greater emotional intelligence. When emotions are not freely discussed, people may feel fearful or have negative feelings towards their superiors. Encourage employees to provide feedback about how they are managed, their projects, and the amount of work they are expected to produce.</li>
            
            <li><em>Flexibility:</em> Employers who are flexible with employees’ schedules, work pace, and work duties can lead to loyalty in the company. People are less likely to be tardy, are willing to work harder, and employees are also less distracted. If you manage or supervise employees who have worked with the company for many years, offer them the opportunity to work remotely once a week.</li>
            
            <li><em>Workers socialize outside of work:</em> Employees interacting outside of work with their leaders gives them the chance to view you as an individual. They will feel more comfortable around you and get to know you a little better. You want your employees to respect you but also to enjoy your company. Arrange a lunch outing occasionally with your employees so you can get to know them on a personal level.</li>
