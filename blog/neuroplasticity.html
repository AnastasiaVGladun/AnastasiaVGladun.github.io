            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <p>
                <b>What is neuroplasticity and how does it work?</b><br>

                Neuroplasticity, or brain plasticity, is your brain’s ability to reorganize itself through your environment, 
                behavior, thinking and emotions. You can do this both physically and functionally throughout your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How do you rewire your brain?</b><br>
                <li>Find clarity</li>
                    Building your brain plasticity is about changing your behaviors. And before setting out on any new behavior change, 
                    most people miss the critical step of finding clarity. Knowing exactly what you want to accomplish, and more importantly, 
                    why you want to accomplish it, is foundational to making any real changes for the long-term.
                <li>Set meaningful goals</li>
                    After finding clarity, you’ll be able to hone in on meaningful goals to set for yourself and also a better understanding of which ones to tackle first. 
                    Goal setting is key to setting yourself up for lifelong learning.
                <li>Take micro-steps</li>    
                    The trick is to take the most minute micro-steps every single day when working toward your goal. 
                    The last thing you want to do is to overwhelm yourself with too much to do, or worse yet, a much-too-big picture goal that 
                    leaves you not knowing where to even start.
                <li>Adopt a growth mindset</li>
                    The growth mindset step is critical and helps you tap into your sense of endurance and stamina.
                    The main point about developing a growth mindset is that it comes with embracing challenges.
                <li>Practice mindfulness</li>
                    Self-awareness is so powerful when developing any new (and good) behavior. Once you’re more aware of your surroundings and thoughts, 
                    and when you’re more awakened to what’s happening in your brain and consciousness, you’ll be more likely to make value-based decisions, 
                    which are basically better more meaningful decisions.
                <li>Carefully select your circle of influence</li>
                    Your circle of influence is so powerful. You become who you most spend time with, so make it count.
                <li>Prioritize an exercise routine</li>
                    Exercise and neuroplasticity go hand in hand.Physical activity takes advantage of the brain’s natural capacity for plasticity.
                <li>Stop procrastinating</li>
                    Of course the longer you wait to change your behavior and habits, the harder it’ll be to increase your brain plasticity. 
                    And if you stop procrastinating, your brain will be less likely to fall victim to the use it or lose it principle.
                <li>Raise your standards</li>
                    By being proactive and taking preventative measures in preparing for your aging self, you’re already on the path to raising your standards. 
                    You’re helping to shift our culture to uproot ageism by taking care of your future self and setting an example for the people around, so thank you for doing all the work.

                <b>Growth Mindset</b><br>
                    Growth mindset is the belief that you can grow and change for the better. In Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, author Carol Dweck 
                    explains that there are many ways to see the world.<br>
                    Fixed-minded people believe that our character, intelligence, and creativity are pre-configured settings that we cannot significantly change. 
                    And people with a "growth mindset" love the challenges that life throws them, and see failure not as signs of stupidity, but as springboards to test their capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growth mindset, helping people understand that their brain can actually grow and become stronger can 
                also boost their confidence and improve learning. The brain is plastic: with focus and practice, the brain can change, it can grow new cells, and we can strengthen neurologic pathways. 
                This is called neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to restructure itself based on repetitive practices. So one follows from the other.<br>
                Practicing neuroplasticity is something that you need to include in your learning plan.
